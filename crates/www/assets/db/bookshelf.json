    "review": "I started to learn Rust back in 2018 writing simple programs. I was looking into understanding better the key concepts of the language and how to \"Think in Rust\". It doesnt matter which language you come from, at the beginning with Rust you will feel like you are fighting the compiler, if you come from dynamic programming languages like JavaScript or Python, lower level concepts like memory management and pointers might sound \"alien\" to you. Well this book not only goes through these concepts, but also walks you through Systems Programming using a practical approach. You can also read the book for free online on it's mdBook version.",

But by 2018/19 it was a thing on the internet, everyone was getting a taste of Golang, either in DevOps land or WebDev for Servers. Well I got interest into it too, and as it was really different to my background languages I decided to grab a book and get into it. I learned Golang and used it  for a little while, it called my attention the First-Class Citizen Support for imaginary numbers!",

These books explains the anatomy on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery syntax using beautiful visual examples which make really easy to understand the purpose of each token. After founding these books I always recommend them for new developers who want to explore the Web Development world.",

Python is a simple language, it makes it easy to jump into the field and Head First Python also brings a great introduction not only to Python but also to programming in general. The book is full of exercises and examples that make it easy to understand the concepts and the language. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to start programming.",
